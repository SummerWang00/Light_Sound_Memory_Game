2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
<br/>At the middle of the project, I was very confused about the variable "progress" and "" and also the entire work flow with so many variables. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
<br/>How do developer keep track of what each variable means, especially when several developers are collaborating on the same project?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
<br/>I would add some addition visual fixes, such as beautifying the game buttons, start buttons, redesign the background interface, and add some addition features.
I would like to make the time interval between the more stable as well through experimenting with interval variables in the JavaScipt file.
